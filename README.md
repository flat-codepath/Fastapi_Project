FastAPI Project - API Development with Python

🚀 Welcome to the FastAPI Playground! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to exploring and mastering the FastAPI framework — a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

Here, I’ll demonstrate various features of FastAPI by building small and efficient APIs, covering topics such as:

RESTful API design
Database integration (SQLAlchemy, SQLite, etc.)
Authentication & Security (OAuth2, JWT)
API testing & documentation (with Swagger and ReDoc)
🔍 What's Inside:

Hands-on examples and practice projects for developing APIs
Well-structured code snippets for learning FastAPI principles
A mix of practical use cases, from simple APIs to complex integrations
Whether you're a beginner wanting to learn API development or an experienced developer looking to sharpen your skills with FastAPI, this repo is a great starting point!

Feel free to fork, contribute, or simply explore the code. Let's build something great together! 💻💡
